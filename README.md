Forest Cover Classification - ML Hack'19

Successful forest cover type classification has a lot of potential for positive change, particularly in areas like environmental conservation, flora and fauna research, and geological studies. Automated data-driven low-cost solutions in ecology have a huge scope to reduce the domain expertise required by Forest reserve officials. An end-to-end ML based system can help get a fair estimate of the type of damage by wildfires in a shorter span of time and help many officials in various ways. While collecting ecological data, it's quite possible that errors can creep in and thus there's a need for robust solutions for classifications.

Here, you'll need to classify whether an annotated tree is a Western Yellow Pine or not.
